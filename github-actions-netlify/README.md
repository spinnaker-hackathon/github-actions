GitHub Actions for Netlify Accounts: Can we devise a workaround for managing Netlify builds for contributors who are unwilling or unable to create a Netlify account and test their PRs themselves?

@bdougie there are existing actions for Netlify. Pls i will appreciate it if we can get more clarifications concerning the challenge 
for github-action-netlify. I saw this article this article which explains a workaround on how to build netify https://medium.com/@wearethreebears/scheduling-jamstack-builds-in-netlify-with-github-actions-509fcc87fa72. Are we suppose to do something similar ?
